# Tic Tac Toe - Under Construction

## Important Note
**The game is still under construction and only the offline mode is working so far!**

## Settings
1. Optional choose a name for each player (by default *Player1* and *Player2*
2. Only the first player is able to choose his favourite token of the list, the other player gets the corresponding remaining token (by default *X* for first player)
3. Choose a board size from 3 x 3 up to 10 x 10 (by default *3 x 3*)
4. Determine how many rounds a player has to win to win the whole game
5. Determine how many tokens of the same player have to follow in a row

## Rules
1. Player 1 starts
2. Alternately placing a token

## Bugs
- The board is dynamically creating by flexboxes and can in some cases cause visually bugs by resizing the window
- In rare cases it might happen that the state of the previously placed tokens will change if the window will be resized
